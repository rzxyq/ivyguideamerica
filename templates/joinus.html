EDUCATION CONSULTING

We provide interview and consultation sessions to assist students with their preparation to apply for American college admissions. We create individualized reports outlining strengths, areas of improvement and action plans in order of priority.  We work with students from all over the world and help them with the general American college admissions process including academics (GPA/TOEFL/SAT/AP), extracurricular activities, references, personal statements, essay questions, choosing a college and a major. 
 
It is very important to note that we do not write essays, edit essays, write recommendation letters or fill out admissions applications for students.  We provide high quality guidance, feedback and suggestions on how to create a strong college application for acceptance to top American colleges.
 
Our oath to students and their parents is to always try our best to:
 
1. Return messages via email or WeChat within 24 hours.
2. Provide the most up to date and accurate information in a timely and easy to understand manner.
3. Learn students' strengths and weaknesses and help turn weaknesses into strengths.
4. Make sure students submit the most complete college application that best showcases their talents and unique story.
5. Work hard, be honest, be genuine and compassionate but also challenge students to help bring out their best.
 
What we expect from students is for them to always try their best to:
 
1. Respond to my messages via email or WeChat within 24 hours.
2. Ask questions no matter how silly they think they might be.
3. Work hard, be honest and genuine.

Specifically we provide these services:
 
Preliminary Ivy Readiness Assessment (Including a 30 minute Video interview and an online scholastic aptitude test; the student will receive a detailed report on his/her potential to study at a Top 30 American college via email in 5 working days).
